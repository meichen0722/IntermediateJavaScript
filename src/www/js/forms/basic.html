Exercise 1
============================================

Create a basic form for filing issues in a bugtracker. It should include the following information:

  1. Story title
  2. Which Epic (Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4) <-- dropdown
  3. Type of story (Feature, Bug, or Chore) <-- radio buttons
  4. Description <-- textarea
  5. Related URL link
  5. Subscribe to updates? <-- checkbox

The form should POST to http://localhost:4000/issues.

Exercise 2
============================================

You're discovering people wind up submitting bad data -- missing story names, no story type, etc. It's time
to add some validations!

Validate the following:

  1. Title, epic, type, and description should all be required
  2. Description should be at least 10 characters long
  3. Related URL should be of URL format https?://...

Lastly, people are tired of choosing "Feature" when that's usually the type of issue being filed. Make that
the default choice.
